# Summary

#Even better standalone mod for Tevo Tornado

This is full redesign of my "better standalone mod for Tevo Tornado": https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3023832. It still greatly reduces the dimensions of printer, improves cooling and making the wiring more neat. But this new version improves a lot of things:

- lower and upper part is designed to be screwed together. Much more durable and looks better
- Now it supports both MKS Gen L and MKS Base boards.
- Boards is located on the outer part of case, so it's much easier to access them
- Now there is no hinges, only screws. A lot of people said it's hard for them to print working hinges, so i decided to make it as simple as possible.
- Board cooling now does not blow towards the printing zone.
- More space for wires

###List of printed parts:
- 1x Lower part (suppors both MKS Base and MKS Gen L boards)
- 1x Upper part
- 2x Hex cover (supports 80x80 and 120x120 computer fans)
- 1x Solid cover
- 4x board spacers

###Warning! Lower and upper part united is really big (380x143x80) and will be difficult to print.

###List of parts for assembly:
- 12x M3x5 screws for covers
- 4x M3x5 screws for assebling the case
- 4x M3x8 screws for attaching the board
- 6x M4x6 screw with nuts to attach case to frame
- Screws and nuts to attach desired fans
- Double-sided tape to attach power supply, SSR and custom electronics

###It's also needed to extend all the wires going into case by about half a meter.

###Adjustable display mount can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3023848
