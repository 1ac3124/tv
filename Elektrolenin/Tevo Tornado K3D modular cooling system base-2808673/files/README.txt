# Summary

K3D modular cooling system for Tevo Tornado
----------------------------------------------------------


###Video instruction (RU): https://youtu.be/Bo5hwqo9qSM

It's a cooling system base module for Tevo Tornado. If you want to use it on your printer, you will need to  print cooling modules for K3D modular cooling system:

- 5015 fan cooling module: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2938019
- 40mm fan cooling module: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2938032

You may also need BLTouch mount module:

###Advantages:

1. Modular design allows you to easily change the configuration when you want it
2. Cooling modules are designed in such a way that the air flow is directed only to the zone requiring cooling.
3. No screw, glue, or anything else is required for assembly
4. All modules are interchangeable
5. The rails can be printed horizontally
6. If you design your module with the same rails, it will fit into the system
7. If you design a base module with the same rail position relative to the extruder nozzle, then all modules will fit into it and will work.

K3D Modular cooling system was created to replace all the others. It gives unlimited possibilities for expansion due to a simple system for connecting modules. You can choose which part of the system to print and install on your printer, and if you do not like something, you can always fix it.

###Warning!
This is a base module of K3D modular cooling system for Tevo Tornado. If you need other modules such as print cooling modules, BLTouch mount modules or orher, try searching for "K3D cooling system" or use those links:





# Print Settings

Printer Brand: TEVO
Printer: Tornado
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.4 or better
Infill: 25%

Notes: 
Preferably use ABS, PETG or other heat-resistant plastics. If you print from the PLA - it will work, but in time it can lose its shape due to high temperatures.

###Warning! 
Use horizontal size compensation setting of your slicer. The recommended value is -0,5mm, can be changed to achieve a tight fit of the modules. If you print with a value of 0mm, then the modules most likely will not be connectable.
